** This readMe file states the names of the projects. **

The first 6 projects in this repository are all those which have been taught by the instructor from whom I am learning... from YouTube. 

Project 1 is a simple color changer program.
Project 2 is a Body Mass Index calculator with very simple layout.
Project 3 is a clock, since I learned the toLocaleTimeString in the Date() function 
Project 4 is a Guess The Number Game.
